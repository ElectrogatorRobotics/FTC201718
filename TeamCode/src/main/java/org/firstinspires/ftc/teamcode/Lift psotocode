If using buttons to move in "steps":

at the start, zero the lift (move until a button is pressed)
    if (!zeroButton)
        runLift(zero)
    else
        stopLift()

now that we now where the lift is, we can start to move it accurately
    switch (liftMode)
        case firstPose:
            runLift(firstPose)

        case secondPose:
             runLift(secondPose)

        ...

        default:
            runLift(zero)

If we are using a joystick:

We don't need to zero the lift because we aren't using the encoder for positioning
    setLiftSpeed(liftJoystick)
